I am a Computer Science major at the University of Oklahoma, set to graduate in Fall 2025. Throughout my time at OU, I have developed a passion for problem-solving and innovation, with a strong focus on database management, Web-Development, and back-end development. I possess a strong passion for innovation and efficient problem-solving, having translated complex academic concepts into tangible applications. My technical expertise is complemented by a hands-on approach, cultivated through rigorous coursework and direct application in real-world scenarios.

My practical experience includes building systems that prioritize visually compelling interfaces and exceptional user experience. This includes leading the end-to-end development of the Candidate Tools web application from the ground up, where I focused heavily on the design and implementation of the interface while integrating critical back-end services like Google authentication. I have also contributed to focused research initiatives in smart transportation and micromobility solutions, enhancing my analytical and technical implementation skills. I am particularly interested in leveraging these skills within the field of video game development, focusing on creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Beyond the technical domain, I hold a deep love and commitment to alpine climbing and high-intensity exercise, including bodybuilding and competing in powerlifting meets. These numerous strenuous hobbies demonstrate exceptional discipline, perseverance, and goal-oriented focus. Successfully summiting notable 14ers like Elbert, Quandary, Kit Karson, Challenger Point, Greys, and Torreys has instilled the mental toughness and meticulous planning I bring to complex development challenges. I am driven to continuously improve and apply my diverse skill set to excel in a challenging and innovative software development role.
